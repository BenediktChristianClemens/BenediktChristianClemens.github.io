### About Me

I am currently enrolled in the masters of Life Science Informatics at the University of Bonn, where I receive training in machine kearning, computer science, structural bioinformatics and biomedical data science. 

Parallel to my graduate studies, I work at one of Germanyâ€™s clusters of excellence (ImmunoSensation2) at the University of Bonn in the Meissner Lab for Systems Immunology and Proteomics. My role involves analyzing medical data to select patients for studies that investigate the Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) and create meaningful plots to inform clinicians using R. The syndrome involves an exaggerated immune response to a noxious stressor (e.g., an infection or surgery). The study aims to identify biomarkers to predict the occurrence of SIRS before surgery is performed. I use surgical data, and blood measurements to draft case and control cohorts from the patient pool. Additionally, I write software to automate the analysis of spatial proteomics data, providing biologists with tools to analyze their experiments in an automated manner.

Prior to this, I completed my undergrad degree in biology at the University of Bonn with two research stays at the Massachusetts General Hospital (2021 and 2022), where I used mass spectrometry-based proteomics for early lung cancer detection. During my studies in Bonn, I worked with transgenic mouse models to study the cytoplasmic FMR1-interacting protein 1 (CYFIP1) 's role in actin assembly and synapse development in the brain and worked in a retirement home with residents suffering from neurodegenerative disease. 

Outside of work, I enjoy being in nature, rock climbing, mountainbiking and traveling.
